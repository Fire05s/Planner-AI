# Planner-AI

A web app designed to help users organize their own schedule using a DeepSeek agent. Users will be able to give task names, due dates, descriptions, and the desired amount of parts they want to subdivide their task into. Users may then adjust the given schedule as they please and download or export the schedule to a calendar of their choice, namely Google Calendar or Outlook Calendar.
